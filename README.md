## Background 

> Through this initiative I‚Äôd like to revisit the almost 20 year old experiment of [‚ÄòThe Hole in the Wall‚Äô](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimally_invasive_education) project by Sugata Mitra, which incorporated minimally invasive education by having a computer kiosk embedded in a wall at less fortunate locations across India.
Given the increased prevalence of smartphones throughout the country but with often limited internet/network coverage in far flung locations or restricted internet access. This along with families deciding on activating/deactivating internet plans to avoid paying high fees/rental plans leads to the friction of thinking about cost before getting answers to a question/query at any point of time.
I propose creating an Android app which can incorporate few of the smaller LLMs for tasks like general QnA, coding help, translation etc. Thereby making educational resources more accessible & available to users without depending on costly cloud GPUs or active internet connections. Adding modalities like STT/TTS on device along with possible image generation could be extensions to this app down the road.

## Roadmap

1. Build an Android app with ```llama.cpp/server.cpp``` as a library via Android NDK (with ```OpenBLAS``` and ```CLBlast``` support if feasible), since I've already verified 3b & 7b models running at decent tok/s at Q4/5 based quantization levels using Termux & Userland

2. Verify models for general chat, code assistance & multi-lingual support-
   
   [ ] microsoft/phi-2 or stabilityai/stablelm-2-1_6b üó®Ô∏è
   
   [ ] stabilityai/stable-code-3b üë®‚Äçüíª

   [ ] mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 üë®‚Äçüè´

   [ ] Tensoic/Kan-LLaMa-SFT-v0.1 ```‡≤ï‡≤®‡≥ç‡≤®‡≤°```

   [ ] sarvamai/OpenHathi-7B-Hi-v0.1-Base ```‡§π‡§ø‡§Ç‡§¶‡•Ä```

4. Add support to incorporate custom data & vector-db for RAG based QnA on-device & toggling to code assistance tasks

### Long term goals

* Look at incorporating on-device STT or Whisper based STT model for translation into English from regional language directly & speak responses via TTS with VAD based interruptibility

* Android WearOS app for handsfree interactions
