## Background 

> Through this initiative Iâ€™d like to revisit the almost 20 year old experiment of [â€˜The Hole in the Wallâ€™](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimally_invasive_education) project by Sugata Mitra, which incorporated minimally invasive education by having a computer kiosk embedded in a wall at less fortunate locations across India.
Given the increased prevalence of smartphones throughout the country but with often limited internet/network coverage in far flung locations or restricted internet access. This along with families deciding on activating/deactivating internet plans to avoid paying high fees/rental plans leads to the friction of thinking about cost before getting answers to a question/query at any point of time.
I propose creating an Android app which can incorporate few of the smaller LLMs for tasks like general QnA, coding help, translation etc. Thereby making educational resources more accessible & available to users without depending on costly cloud GPUs or active internet connections. Adding modalities like STT/TTS on device along with possible image generation could be extensions to this app down the road.

## Roadmap

* Extend llama.cpp's example Android app with OpenCL support to make use CPU & GPU, already verified 1.6b, 3b & 7b models running at decent tok/s at Q4/Q8 quantization on CPU via termux & this app

* Add support to incorporate custom data & vector-db for RAG based QnA on-device & toggling to code assistance tasks

* Fix bugs with message history & unloading models completely

### Long term goals

* Tool/Function calling via grammar & file output generation/sharing

* Look at incorporating on-device STT or Whisper based STT model for translation into English from regional language directly & respond via TTS with VAD based interruptibility

* Android Assistant integration, widget on home/lock screens & notification shade
